# Assignment Overview 
1. Create a nicely organized repo with a Python implementation of the JavaScript code for a singly-linked list in the appendix of Mike Bostock's Linked Lists Observable notebook: https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/linked-lists. 
2. Implement a test suite using the same unittest technology as in the Python implemention: https://github.com/kuwisdelu/containers/blob/main/containers/tests/test_llist.py. 
  - Tests should assure basic functionality described in the Observable notebook.
     - Insert a Node at a given position based on value of next node
     - Insert a Node at the end of a list where the next value is None
     -  Insert a Node at the beginning of the list where the value becomes the new head. 
     -  Inser a Node into an empty list. 
  - Your repository should end up being much simpler than the Python implementation, if only because of it's limited objectives.
